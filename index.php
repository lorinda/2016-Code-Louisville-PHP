                         <h3>Five Things To Know About Bankruptcy</h3>
                        <div class="col-md-6">

                            <ol>
                                <b><li>Will I lose my money or property?</li></b>
                                <p class="left">Many people think that they will lose their property if they file for bankruptcy. 
                                    THAT IS NOT TRUE! Bankruptcy can stop repossession, foreclosure, garnishment, and bank levies.</p>
                                <p class="left">Most of our clients do not lose any property through the bankruptcy process! Many times you can 
                                    file to reaffirm your debts or redeem your debts in a Chapter 7 case. Good bankruptcy lawyers 
                                    will protect your assets and discuss how to accomplish your financial goals before filing your 
                                    case. Our office does NOT file any cases without describing exactly how it will affect 
                                    your property!</p>
                                <b><li>What is the difference between Chapter 7 and Chapter 13?</li></b>
                                <p class="left">Chapter 7 bankruptcy is &quot;straight bankruptcy&quot;. You do NOT pay your debts except your car or your 
                                    house if you want to keep them. You must be current on your secured debt to keep them. You must 
                                    qualify to file Chapter 7 and our office will perform a &quot;means test&quot; or an income test to make 
                                    sure you qualify. Chapter 7 bankruptcy is often the best option for a financial fresh start.</p>

                                <p class="left">Chapter 13 bankruptcy is &quot;wage earner&quot; or a payment plan. Chapter 13 is designed to save property 
                                    that you are behind on including houses and cars. Chapter 13 can also get your driver&#39;s license 
                                    back for unpaid court fines or child support arrears. Chapter 13 is a court-approved 
                                    reorganization of your debts into one simple payment plan through a Chapter 13 Trustee. Your 
                                    payments can come directly out of your paycheck. Chapter 13 provides many individuals more time 
                                    and better options to handle their debts.</p>
                            </ol>
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-md-6">
                            <ol start="3">
                                <b><li>Can I put payday loans under bankruptcy?</li></b>
                                <p class="left">YES! All debts that you owe must be included in your petition for bankruptcy and all creditors 
                                    are treated the same. Once you file for bankruptcy, personal loans and payday loans are included 
                                    just like any other debts.</p>

                                <b><li>Does bankruptcy stop criminal cases against me?</li></b>
                                <p class="left">No! Filing for bankruptcy does not affect criminal cases. HOWEVER, a Chapter 13 bankruptcy can stop 
                                    courts from holding you in contempt for failure to pay as the court directed. These are usually 
                                    child support orders and Chapter 13 bankruptcy can stop you from Shelby County Juvenile Court holding 
                                    you in contempt for child support.</p>

                                <b><li>Will I ever be able to buy anything after bankruptcy?</li></b>
                                <p class="left">Of course! This is the question most people have incorrect information about. Back in the 1980s, when 
                                    consumer credit was given through the banks, bankruptcy could haunt your credit for years. THIS IS 
                                    NOT TRUE ANYMORE!</p> 
                                    
                                <p class="left">Bankruptcy does stay on your credit reports for 8 years after the last date of 
                                    activity. However, it does not stop you from obtaining credit. You can buy a home, car, or furniture 
                                    after bankruptcy. There are mortgage companies and auto finance companies that have specific plans 
                                    for individuals with bankruptcy on their credit reports. Many of our clients see their credit scores 
                                    INCREASE after their bankruptcy is complete! This is because your DEBT TO INCOME ratio decreases 
                                    dramatically. <br>Less collectable debts on your credit report = better credit scores.<br></p>

                            Termination, Establishment/Disestablishment of Paternity</h3>

                            <p class="left">Often times non-custodial parents make a huge mistake when they choose to represent 
                            themselves in child support hearings, and they are unaware of the laws and how the lack of 
                            evidence and lack of preparation can negatively affect the outcome of their child support case.</p>

                            <p class="left">Tennessee adopted the income shares model: child support is based upon the income of 
                            both parents with many other factors being considered such as childcare, health insurance, 
                            reoccurring medical costs and extraordinary expenses. Our firm is experienced in all areas of 
                            child support from the magistrate level to the appellate courts.</p>

                            <p class="left">All parents have a right to visit and have parenting time with their children unless there are 
                                reasons why visitation would be harmful to the child. Although parents have their problems, 
                                children should not get caught in the middle. Co-Parenting can be a healthy alternative.</p>

                    results. We are affordable!</p> 
                    
                <p>Our uncontested divorce retainers start as low as $450 (with no chidren or property) &amp; $650 
				(with children and no property). Our contested divorce retainers start at $1,150. Other fees may apply and

                <h3>Some Facts about Tennessee Divorces:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Divorces <b>with</b> children must be on file for at least ninety (90) days before the divorce can be granted.</li>
                    <li>Divorces <b>without</b> children must be on file for at least (60) days before the divorce can ge granted.</li>
                    <li>Children born during the marriage, but not of the marriage, must be mentioned in the divorce paperwork 
                        so there can be a disestablishment of paternity.<br>  The husband is presumed to be the father of the 
                        child.</li>
                    <li>Child support must be set in all cases with minor children according to the Tennessee Child Support 
                        Guidelines.  Private agreements of the parents are not enforceable.</li>
